Version 3.0
-----------

 - this will be the first official release of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench
 - should be released as soon as possible, after some testing by developer community (and perhaps an overhaul of installation procedure)
 - hopefully, binary packages for various platforms will be contributed by volunteers

New features:

 - Configuration no longer requires explicit knowledge of CPU endianness, relying instead on system macros
   htonl() and nothl() to convert between platform-independent disk format and native byte ordering.
   This simplifies compilation on generic Unix platforms and allows true Universal releases on Mac OS X.

 - cwb-encode now supports format validation and normalisation for feature set attributes (see CQP tutorial for
   and introduction).  Attributes declared with trailing slash "/" are considered as feature sets.  If a value
   is not well-formed, a warning is issued (for every line containing a malformed feature set!) and the value
   is replaced by the empty set |.  Annotations of s-attributes can also be treated as feature sets, including
   individual element attributes; in this case, the "/" marker has to be attached to the main attribute name
   (e.g. -V flags/:2) or the respective element attribute declaration (e.g. -S np:2+agr/+head+f/).
   
 - New "-F <dir>" option for cwb-encode reads all input files named *.vrt or *.vrt.gz in the specified
   directory (very convenient if a corpus consists of many small individual files).  Only regular files will
   be considered, and it is not possible to scan subdirectories recursively.  If no input files are found
   in a directory, a warning message is printed on stderr, but the encoding process continues.

Bug fixes:

 - [2008-01-03] Fixed a strange bug in which the query
        ([pos = "IN|TO"] [pos = "DT.*"]? [pos = "JJ.*"]* [pos = "N.*"]+){3};
   causes CQP to segfault on Darwin/PowerPC platforms (discovered on Mac OS X 10.4 with PowerPC G4 CPU).
   The problem occurs for >= 3 repetitions, but not for 1 or 2 repetitions.  It turned out that 
   AddState()<cqp/regex2dfa.c> reallocates the state table STab[], which might move it to a different
   memory location, breaking a pointer into the array held by calling function FormState() in a local variable SP.
   This bug was difficult to find because it only causes problems if the original memory location of STab[]
   is overwritten immediately (perhaps by shifting STab[] to an overlapping location); otherwise, access through
   the stale copy pointed to by SP works fine.  To fix the bug, SP is now updated in FormState()<cqp/regex2dfa.c>
   immediately after calling AddState().

 - [2008-05-05] Added code to detect infinite loops in FSA simulation when executing a standard CQP query. Such
   loops can be caused by unlimited quantification over zero-width elements (XML tags and lookahead constraints),
   but will be triggered only in certain circumstances. While these queries are obviously nonsensical, novice
   users of Web interfaces often write things like ``<s> * ...'', thinking that ``*'' matches an arbitrary word.
   Some examples should illustrate the problem:
        <s> *         # not executed ("start state is final state")
        <s> +         # runs normally, but returns no matches (because all matches have length zero)
        <s> * []      # works correctly in standard mode, but triggers infinite loop in longest match mode
        <s> * "xxx"   # gets stuck in infinite loop if "xxx" doesn't match
        "!" (<p> <s> | [: word = "[A-Z].*" :]){3,} "The"  # infinite loops aren't always easy to detect
   A simple solution has been implemented which tests the state/position vector after each FSA simulation step.
   If the vector hasn't changed, the FSA must be in an infinite loop and query execution is aborted with an
   emphatic error message (in case the new code should abort a valid query). This catches most cases, but some
   more complex situations (as the last example above) will still get stuck: because of the way the FSA is
   implemented in CQP, it will oscillate between different configurations of active states.  A fully reliable
   solution would require an analysis of "empty" cycles in the FSA before query execution.

 - [2008-08-29] If CQP is run as a backend and the master process is killed, CQP hangs and produces 100% CPU load,
   apparently because it's still trying to read from its input pipe which keeps returning error conditions. As a
   workaround, CQP now exits immediately (with an error message on stderr) if it is running in child mode (-c) and
   and error condition is detected on the input stream.

 - [2009-01-04] Fixed all compiler warnings where possible (for Universal build on Mac OS X with gcc-4.0)

 - [2009-01-05] The "-d" (data directory) option for cwb-encode is now mandatory, so if you just type "cwb-encode",
   it will no longer litter your current working directory with empty data files and wait for standard input.

Version 2.2.b99 (2007-03-11)
----------------------------

 - initial public release of the CWB source code on http://cwb.sf.net
 - source code and build system has already been cleaned up from the IMS-internal version
 - intended to be ready for public release (as v3.0) without major changes or additions
