##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: Windows binaries cross-compiled via MinGW
##

## Directory tree where binaries, libraries, header files and man pages will be installed
## We can set this in Windows, but we will need to allow an override at install time.
PREFIX = C:\CWB

## Install locations are given to override the default paths, which include /s
BININSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\bin
MANINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\share\man
LIBINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\lib
INCINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\include\cwb

## Default registry directory (used unless -r option or CORPUS_REGISTRY variable is set)
## For Windows, our best guess is "current directory". This will almost never be correct!
DEFAULT_REGISTRY = .


### [AH notes -- I am still not sure about the preceding, we will see if it works out!!]

## Access permission for installed files (octal code for regular files)
## Windows doesn't support octal permissions. When NTFS disks are mounted in Linux, all
## files appear as having 777 -- so that's what I've gone for here.  
INST_PERM = 777

## static linking supported by the mingw cross-compiler apparently
SITE_CFLAGS =
SITE_LDFLAGS = -static
