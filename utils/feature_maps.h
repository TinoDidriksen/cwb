target corpus. Allocates return vectors <out1> and <out2> which contain <steps>
alignment points each. Alignment points are given as sentence numbers and 
correspond to the start points of the sentences. at the end-of-region alignment
point, sentence numbers will be <l1> + 1 and <l2> + 1, which must be considered by
the caller if <l1> (or <l2>) is the last sentence in the corpus!
The similarity measures of aligned regions are returned in the vector <out_quality>.

NB memory allocation of the output vectors is handled internally. <out1>, <out2> and 
<out_quality> must not be dealloctaed by the caller. calling best_path() will overwrite
the results of the previous search.
